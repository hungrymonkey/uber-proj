These MATLAB files are used to analyze data from the Uber TLC lawsuit. 

Our group used various clustering algorithms and regression to determine where Uber can direct their efforts to dispatch demand.
We analyzed data between April 2014 to August 2014.

## Fitting weekday (Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday...) and time (minutes) vs demand.

###  April - 3rd order regression
